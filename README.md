I am developing a fully responsive multi-page e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project aims to create a professional and visually stunning website, incorporating modern CSS techniques such as Flexbox and CSS Grid for efficient layout management. The website will feature a responsive navbar and footer to ensure a seamless user experience across various devices. By utilizing advanced responsive design principles, including media queries, the site will adapt perfectly to different screen sizes. The project will also focus on using common components and layout patterns to achieve a cohesive and professional design, ultimately building a high-quality e-commerce platform that demonstrates both technical skill and creative design.
